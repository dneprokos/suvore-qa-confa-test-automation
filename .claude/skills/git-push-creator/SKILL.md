  Push the current local branch to `origin` using the same branch name on the

  commits. If the current branch is the resolved core branch (`main` or
  `develop`), abort and return a safety message.

# Git Push Creator

Push the current branch to `origin` safely.

## When this skill fits

Use it for requests like:

- "push my current branch"
- "publish this branch to origin"
- "push local commits to remote"

Do **not** use it for:

- pushing the core branch (`main` or `develop`)
- force pushing
- deleting remote branches
- opening pull requests

## Workflow

### 1. Detect the current branch

Check the current local branch name first.

Resolve the core branch first (`main` preferred, then `develop`).

If the branch matches that resolved core branch, stop immediately and return:

```text
You cannot push to the <core-branch> branch with this skill.
```

### 2. Use the same branch name on remote

Push the local branch to `origin` using the same branch name remotely.

Example:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./.claude/skills/git-push-creator/scripts/push-branch.ps1
```

The helper script will:

- confirm the workspace is a Git repository
- detect the current branch
- resolve the core branch (`main` then `develop`)
- abort if the current branch matches the resolved core branch
- push to `origin/<same-branch-name>`
- set upstream if needed

### 3. Return the exact git result

Do not guess success. Return the real git output after the push completes.

## Hard rules

- Never push the resolved core branch (`main` or `develop`) with this skill.
- Never rename the remote branch; it must match the local branch name.
- Do not use `--force` or `--force-with-lease` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Return the exact git result instead of summarizing vaguely.
