# Test Design — Lint Fixture: traced-only coverage items

# Summary

Scenarios: 3  |  Automatable: 2  |  Manual only: 1
Levels: _pending classification._
Requirements: FR 3/3, AC 0/0 covered
Techniques: EP 2/4 (1 traced-only), BVA n/a, DT n/a, ST n/a

# Scenarios

## SCN-001: The panel after a delete that the server refuses
Requirement: FR-1.1
Category: Error handling
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-1, EP-2
Priority: Medium
Preconditions: An admin account exists and the delete is refused by the server.
Action: The owner deletes the admin account.
Expected: Not assertable — the requirements do not state what the panel shows once a delete is refused.
Suggested Level: E2E UI
Automation Suitability: Manual only
Notes: unknown: what the panel shows once a delete is refused — not assertable

## SCN-002: The owner reaches the admin panel after signing in
Requirement: FR-1.2
Category: Happy path
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-2
Priority: High
Preconditions: An owner account exists.
Action: The owner signs in and navigates to the admin panel.
Expected: The admin panel is reached and lists the existing admin accounts.
Suggested Level: E2E UI
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: —

## SCN-003: A signed-out visitor is refused the admin panel
Requirement: FR-1.3
Category: Permission / authorization
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-3
Priority: High
Preconditions: No session exists.
Action: A signed-out visitor opens the admin panel.
Expected: The sign-in page is shown and no admin account is listed.
Suggested Level: E2E UI
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: —

# Coverage Gaps

- SCN-001 — the requirements do not state the panel's behaviour once a delete is refused. The scenario is recorded for traceability and carries no assertable outcome.
- EP-1 is cited only by SCN-001, which asserts nothing, so the partition is traced rather than exercised. EP-2 is cited by SCN-002 as well, so it is genuinely exercised.
- EP-4 is declared and cited by no scenario at all — the signed-in non-owner role has no scenario in this fixture.
