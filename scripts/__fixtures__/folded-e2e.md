# Test Design — Lint Fixture: a classified design with no requirement gaps

# Summary

Scenarios: 3  |  Automatable: 3  |  Manual only: 0
Levels: E2E API 1, E2E UI 2
Requirements: FR 2/2, AC 1/1 covered
Techniques: EP 2/2, BVA n/a, DT n/a, ST n/a

# Scenarios

## SCN-001: Admin row renders its three columns
Requirement: FR-1.1
Category: Happy path
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-1
Priority: High
Preconditions: One admin account exists.
Action: The owner opens the admin panel.
Expected: The admin row shows the name, the e-mail address and the role.
Suggested Level: Component
Assigned Level: E2E UI
Level Rationale: The row renders from the real list response reaching the real panel — factor 3.
Folds Into: SCN-003
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: —

## SCN-002: A visitor is refused the admin list
Requirement: FR-1.2
Category: Permission / authorization
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-2
Priority: High
Preconditions: No session is established.
Action: A visitor requests the admin list.
Expected: The request is refused and no admin data is returned.
Suggested Level: E2E API
Assigned Level: E2E API
Level Rationale: An authorization boundary is only real at the public surface — factor 1.
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: —

## SCN-003: The owner reaches the admin panel after signing in
Requirement: AC-1
Category: Happy path
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-1
Priority: High
Preconditions: An owner account exists.
Action: The owner signs in and navigates to the admin panel.
Expected: The admin panel is reached and lists the existing admin accounts.
Suggested Level: E2E UI
Assigned Level: E2E UI
Level Rationale: A journey across routes with a real session — factor 3, no stub reproduces it.
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: —

| Level | Count | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | 0 | — |

| E2E API | 1 | SCN-002 |
| E2E UI | 2 | SCN-001, SCN-003 |

Scenarios: 3 total, 3 assigned, 0 unassigned.
Multi-level scenarios: — none
Overridden suggestions: SCN-001 (Component -> E2E UI)
E2E tests implied: E2E API 1, E2E UI 1 (1 scenario(s) folded into another scenario's test).
E2E journeys: 2 — J1 owner reaches the admin panel (SCN-003 positive, no negative available); J2 visitor refused the admin list over the API (SCN-002 negative, no positive available).
Demoted by the minimum-set pass: — none
Folded by the minimum-set pass: SCN-001 -> SCN-003 (same journey J1, a second data partition over one traversal).
