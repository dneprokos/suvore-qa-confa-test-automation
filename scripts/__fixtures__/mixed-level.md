# Test Design — Lint Fixture: Requirement Gap mixed with a test level

# Summary

Scenarios: 2  |  Automatable: 2  |  Manual only: 0
Levels: Component 1, E2E UI 1, Requirement Gap 2
Requirements: FR 2/2, AC 0/0 covered
Techniques: EP 2/2, BVA n/a, DT n/a, ST n/a

# Scenarios

## SCN-001: The panel after a delete that the server refuses
Requirement: FR-1.1
Category: Error handling
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-1
Priority: Medium
Preconditions: An admin account exists and the delete is refused by the server.
Action: The owner deletes the admin account.
Expected: Not assertable — the requirements do not state what the panel shows once a delete is refused.
Suggested Level: E2E UI
Assigned Level: Component, Requirement Gap
Level Rationale: Hedged between a level and a gap — the shape TD-E04 rejects.
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: unknown: what the panel shows once a delete is refused — not assertable

## SCN-002: The owner reaches the admin panel after signing in
Requirement: FR-1.2
Category: Happy path
Technique: Equivalence Partitioning
Coverage Item: EP-2
Priority: High
Preconditions: An owner account exists.
Action: The owner signs in and navigates to the admin panel.
Expected: The admin panel is reached and lists the existing admin accounts.
Suggested Level: E2E UI
Assigned Level: Requirement Gap, E2E UI
Level Rationale: Hedged the other way round — the pseudo-level leading a real one.
Automation Suitability: High
Notes: —

# Coverage Gaps

- SCN-001 — the requirements do not state the panel's behaviour once a delete is refused.

# Approved Assumptions

_None._

# Test Basis Analysis

## Equivalence Partitions

| Id | Parameter | Partition | Valid |
|---|---|---|---|
| EP-1 | delete outcome | refused by the server | no |
| EP-2 | role | owner | yes |

## Boundary Values

_Not applicable — this fixture states no ordered limit._

## Decision Tables

_Not applicable — this fixture states no multi-condition rule._

## State Transitions

_Not applicable — this fixture states no entity state model._

# Level Assignment Summary

_Levels assigned by the classification step. Suggested Level lines above are the original proposals and are preserved deliberately._

| Level | Count | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | 0 | — |
| Component | 1 | SCN-001 |
| Integration | 0 | — |
| E2E API | 0 | — |
| E2E UI | 1 | SCN-002 |
| Requirement Gap | 2 | SCN-001, SCN-002 |

Scenarios: 2 total, 2 assigned, 0 unassigned.
Executable coverage: 0 scenario(s) at a testing level; 2 recorded as Requirement Gap and excluded from every E2E figure.
Multi-level scenarios: SCN-001 (Component + Requirement Gap), SCN-002 (Requirement Gap + E2E UI)
Overridden suggestions: SCN-001 (E2E UI -> Component, Requirement Gap), SCN-002 (E2E UI -> Requirement Gap, E2E UI)
E2E tests implied: E2E API 0, E2E UI 1.
E2E journeys: — none
Demoted by the minimum-set pass: — none
Folded by the minimum-set pass: — none

## Handed Off As Follow-Up Work

Scenarios at levels not implemented in this repository. Kept here for traceability.

_None._

## Blocked / Requirement Gaps

Scenarios whose `Expected:` records a missing or unassertable oracle. Not automation work and not coverage at any level — the requirement has to be specified before a level applies.

| Scenario | Requirement | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| SCN-001 | FR-1.1 | Not assertable — the requirements do not state what the panel shows once a delete is refused. |
| SCN-002 | FR-1.2 | The admin panel is reached and lists the existing admin accounts. |
