/**
 * workflow-state.mjs — deterministic checks over one QA workflow state file.
 *
 * `.workflow/<TICKET-ID>.yaml` is the resume contract: the orchestrator writes it after every step,
 * and the next delegation is parameterised from it. A field that silently loses its value therefore
 * does not fail loudly — it re-runs a reviewer in full-review mode, or hands an implementer an
 * unscoped revision, at full token cost and with nothing in the transcript to say why.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `.workflow/SCRUM-132.yaml` carried `test_design.last_findings` twice:
 * once holding an 1800-character routing block, once holding `null`. YAML is last-wins, so every
 * consumer read `null` and a whole review loop ran without the findings it was routing on.
 *
 * This script turns that class of defect from silent data loss into a loud failure at the next step.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs validate        <TICKET-ID|path> [--json] [--strict] [--metrics <p>]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs get             <TICKET-ID|path> <dotted.path> [--json]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs check-artifacts  <TICKET-ID|path> [--json] [--root <dir>]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs check-streams   <TICKET-ID|path> [--json] [--design <path>]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs print-schema    [--json | --markdown]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs init            <TICKET-ID|path> [--set <path>=<value>]...
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs set             <TICKET-ID|path> <path>=<value>... [--allow-unknown]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs set-block       <TICKET-ID|path> <path> --from-stdin | --from-file <p>
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs append          <TICKET-ID|path> <path> --json '<json>' [--dedupe]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs clear-in-flight <TICKET-ID|path> [--agent <name>] [--step <id>]
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs normalize       <TICKET-ID|path>
 *   node scripts/workflow-state.mjs reset           <TICKET-ID|path> --reason <why> [--dry-run]
 *
 * A bare ticket id resolves to `.workflow/<TICKET-ID>.yaml` under the repository root; anything else
 * is taken as a path, so a fixture or a scratch copy can be checked directly.
 *
 * THE WRITE COMMANDS EXIST SO THE ORCHESTRATOR STOPS HAND-WRITING YAML. Every one of them re-emits
 * the whole document from the parsed model, atomically, and is idempotent by value: a `set` writing
 * what is already there prints `unchanged` and does not touch mtime, and `init` over an existing file
 * prints `EXISTS` and changes nothing. `set-block --from-stdin` is how a multi-line findings block
 * reaches the file without passing through shell quoting.
 *
 * `reset` is the one command that moves a run backwards, and the only one that touches a file other
 * than the state file. It archives by rename — never by deletion — and re-initialises, because the
 * alternative was already happening at a shell prompt three times over.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  clean, or warnings only; a write that happened, and a write that was already satisfied
 *   1  violations found, or a write refused over a document with duplicate keys; WS-E41, a rename
 *      that failed part-way through a reset
 *   2  usage error, or a write to a path the schema does not define without --allow-unknown; WS-E40,
 *      a reset with no free archive name left
 *   3  the file is missing, or holds a YAML construct this parser refuses to guess at
 *   4  check-artifacts only: the document is fine and a path it names is gone from disk
 *
 * ERRORS ARE STRUCTURE; WARNINGS ARE DRIFT. A duplicate key, an unknown enum value or a missing
 * required key is an error: some consumer will read the wrong thing. An *unknown* key is only a
 * warning, because the orchestrator demonstrably needs fields the schema lacks and erroring would
 * push it back to hand-writing the file — the very failure being removed. `--strict` promotes the
 * warnings, and the test suite runs `--strict` against the fixtures, so schema and fixtures cannot
 * drift apart quietly. The designated home for a field the schema has no opinion on is a `notes:`
 * map, at the top level or inside a section; nothing under `notes.` is ever reported as unknown.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DECIDE. It never rules on whether a routing decision was right, whether
 * a verdict was read correctly, whether an iteration should have been spent, or whether the prose in
 * `last_findings` says anything useful. It checks that the file means what it appears to mean.

// The state file is a record of what happened, not of what still exists. Three runs have now
// resumed on a phase the file recorded correctly and then failed at the point of use, because the
// artifacts that phase presupposes had been deleted, renamed or reset underneath it — the
// 2026-08-17 SCRUM-132 run resumed at `phase: ship`, validated clean, and found the spec carrying
// all four implemented scenarios gone, nine delegations later. Step 0's existence check is scoped
// to `in_flight:`, which is empty on a run that completed its delegations, so a step already
// recorded as done is never re-checked.
//
// This mode stats every path the document names and says which are gone. It rules on nothing: a
// missing artifact is a fact to announce and route on, exactly as a non-empty `in_flight:` is, and
// deciding whether that means a re-run, an escalation or a shrug is the orchestrator's job. Hence
// exit 4 rather than 1 — drift found, not a file to repair before the next command.

 * drift check stats cannot fall out of step. `rename` is every artifact whose mere existence makes
 * an agent resolve to `EXISTS` and refuse to work — the two phase-1 documents and both
 * implementation reports. `keep` is live source: renaming a spec would leave it compiling, still

// reset — the drop to the first stage
//
// Everything else here moves a run forwards. This is the one command that puts one back at the
// beginning, and it exists because the alternative was already happening by hand: `.workflow/
// SCRUM-132.yaml` carries a step-0 note describing a reset done with three renames at a shell
// prompt, and it calls itself the third occurrence. The naming it invented is the naming used here.
//
// Two rules shape the whole command.
//
// ARCHIVE, NEVER DELETE. Every displaced file is renamed to a name nothing else uses. That is what
// makes the absence of a rollback safe: a half-finished reset has lost nothing, because each
// completed move put its file somewhere the receipt has already named.
//
// THE STATE FILE MOVES SECOND TO LAST. It is the index of everything else, so while it is still in
// place a failure leaves a document that still describes the world — and re-running `reset` re-plans
// correctly from it, skipping each row whose source is now `absent`. Archive it first and a later
// failure leaves the only index inside a `.bak` nothing reads.
//
// What it does not touch: `artifacts.metrics`, which the hooks own, and every `created_tests` entry,
// which is live TypeScript. Renaming a spec to `old_do_not_use_*.ts` leaves it matched by `testDir`
// and imported by whatever imported it — a rename that buys a confusing name and no isolation. They
// are reported instead, because "nothing owns these four files now" is the fact the human needs.
