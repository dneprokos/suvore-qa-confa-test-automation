# API Spec Etalon

The house form for a Playwright API spec under `tests/api/`. One document, two readers: whoever writes
a new spec copies this shape, and whoever reviews one calibrates against it. A style finding is a
departure from *this*, never from a preference formed on the spot.

**The files on disk outrank this sketch.** `tests/api/admin-api.spec.ts` and
`tests/api/login-api.spec.ts` are the canonical in-repo references for file layout, titles and
assertion style, and `tests/api/games-search-api.spec.ts` for a query-parameter filter over a shared
collection — self-seeded match data, the response's own metadata as the count oracle, and a defect
asserted against the specification; where the repository and this document disagree, the repository is
right and the difference is not a finding.

One rule survives that precedence, because it post-dates the specs on disk: **the `// Act` is always
the builder, one `with*()` call per field sent.** An older spec that acts through a controller method
or through `withMatchingPassword` predates the rule. New code follows the rule; the old specs are not
retrofitted to match, and they are not evidence against it.

## The layers

```
fixtures/api-fixture.ts          test, expect, and the fixtures `api`, `ownerToken`, `createdAdminEmails`
  └─ ApiFacade                   api.auth, api.admin
       └─ AuthApi / AdminApi     controller — one method per common call
            └─ *RequestBuilder   fluent with*() → send*(), the escape hatch
                 └─ toApiResult  { response, status, ok, body }

utils/test-data/*                AdminTestData, AuthTestData — every value a spec sends
utils/response-patterns.ts       ResponsePatterns — every regex a spec asserts
@framework/configuration/config  Config — every credential, from .env
```

`toApiResult` never assumes JSON: an empty body becomes `undefined`, a non-JSON body stays raw text.
That is why a negative test can assert `result.status` without dying in a parse error — and why a spec
asserts `result.status` / `result.ok` / `result.body`, never the raw `APIResponse`.

## Which layer a scenario needs

The rule is the phase, not the payload: **the builder performs the Act, the controller performs the
preconditions and the postconditions.** A reader of the `// Act` block must be able to see every field
the request carries without opening another file, and that is only true when each field has its own
`with*` call.

| Phase | Layer | Call |
|---|---|---|
| `// Arrange` — data must exist before the Act | controller | `api.admin.createAdmin(ownerToken, AdminTestData.createAdminPayload(email))` |
| `// Arrange` — a token, a seeded record, an id to act on | controller | `api.auth.login({ email, password })`, `api.admin.listAdmins(ownerToken)` |
| **`// Act` — the request under test, happy path or negative, always** | **builder** | `api.admin.adminBuilder().withBearerToken(ownerToken).withEmail(e).withPassword(p).withConfirmPassword(p).sendCreateAdmin()` |
| `// Assert` — the cross-check that the record does or does not exist | controller | `api.admin.listAdmins(ownerToken)` |
| cleanup outside `createdAdminEmails` | controller | `api.admin.deleteAdmin(ownerToken, id)` |

Inside the Act, spell the request out field by field:

| The Act sends | Write |
|---|---|
| every field of a well-formed body | `.withEmail(e).withPassword(p).withConfirmPassword(p)` — one call per field, in body order |
| a mismatched confirmation, or any two fields set apart | ``.withPassword(p).withConfirmPassword(`${p}x`)`` |
| a field the scenario omits | leave its `with*` call out, and say so in the `// Arrange` comment |
| a body no type allows — a string, a number, `{}`, `null` | `.withRawBody({})`, `.withRawBody("not-json")` |
| missing or invalid auth | omit `withBearerToken`, or `.withBearerToken(AuthTestData.MALFORMED_TOKEN)` |
| a call no controller or builder exposes yet | add the method to `services/api/controllers/` or `services/api/builders/` and the route to `services/api/endpoints.ts` — never a raw `request.post(...)` in a spec |

Two shortcuts are **banned in an `// Act` block**, because both hide a sent value from the reader:

- `withMatchingPassword(p)` — it sets two fields under one name. Write
  `.withPassword(p).withConfirmPassword(p)`.
- `withBody(payload)` / `AdminTestData.createAdminPayload(email)` as the Act body — the fields live in
  another file. Both stay legal in `// Arrange`, where the call is a precondition and its exact shape
  is not what the test is about.

`withRawBody` is the one exception: a body that is deliberately not an object has no fields to spell
out, and the literal in the call already shows what was sent.

`Config` (`@framework/configuration/config`) is the only source of credentials — `Config.OWNER_EMAIL`,
`Config.OWNER_PASSWORD` — and `api.auth.loginAsOwner()` already wraps the owner login the `ownerToken`
fixture uses.

## Two response shapes, and one environment limit

- `GET /api/admin/users` returns Mongoose documents: `AdminUser._id`, plus `updatedAt` and an optional
  `lastLogin`.
- `POST /api/admin/users` returns `CreateAdminResponse.admin.id` — `id`, not `_id`, and no `lastLogin`.
  Asserting `_id` on a create response fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the scenario.
- `.env` currently points `ADMIN_EMAIL` at the same address as `OWNER_EMAIL`, so a token obtained "as
  admin" is an owner token. A scenario that needs a **non-owner role rejected with 403** cannot be
  honestly automated here: it would pass for the wrong reason. Skip it, name this as the reason, and
  record it under `Known Limitations` — `tests/api/admin-api.spec.ts` carries exactly that comment at
  the top of the file.

## Setup and cleanup over the API — always

| Situation | Do |
|---|---|
| the test needs an admin that already exists | seed it with `api.admin.createAdmin` in `// Arrange`, assert the seed status, push the e-mail to `createdAdminEmails` |
| the create call *is* the Act | push the e-mail to `createdAdminEmails` **before** the call, so cleanup runs even when the assertion fails |
| the delete call is the Act | still push it — `findAdminIdsByEmail` returns nothing afterwards and cleanup becomes a no-op |
| an entity `createdAdminEmails` does not cover | seed it through that entity's **seeding fixture** — `seedGame` for a game — which registers the removal before it returns |
| a seeding fixture does not exist for the entity | register the removal on `cleanupTasks` at the moment the record exists, before any assertion |
| the request under test must fail before anything is created | no registration needed, and say so in a comment |

Never arrange through a second HTTP client, a database call, or a UI flow. `createdAdminEmails` cleanup
runs through the owner token the fixture already holds.

### A seeded record is one line, and the fixture owns the rest

`createdAdminEmails` is a *fixture*, not a pattern to hand-write per entity. The equivalent for any
other resource is a seeding fixture in `fixtures/api-fixture.ts` — `seedGame` is the worked example —
which creates the record, registers its removal **before returning**, and **throws** when the seed
produced nothing usable:

```ts
// Arrange - two games, so the removed one is not the catalogue's only entry
const keptGame = await seedGame(GameTestData.uniqueGamePayload());
const removedGame = await seedGame(GameTestData.uniqueGamePayload());
```

It throws for the same reason `ownerToken` throws on a failed login: **a seed that produced no usable
record is a broken precondition, not a finding about the behaviour under test.** That is what keeps the
branch, the status assertion and the `as string` cast out of every `// Arrange` block — and there is no
information lost, because the returned object carries `id`, `name` and `status` for a scenario whose
`Expected:` names one of them.

Two failure modes, reported differently, once, inside the fixture:

| The seed | The fixture does |
|---|---|
| did not succeed | throws. Nothing was created, so there is nothing to clean up **and nothing to report as uncleanable** |
| succeeded, id unreadable | pushes the label to `uncleanableResources`, **then** throws — a record exists that this run cannot remove |

Collapsing those two into one `if (id)` branch is how a rejected `400` came to print
`NOT CLEANED UP: game "..." - created (status 400)` for a record that never existed.

**Adding a seeding fixture is inside this stream's write boundary** — `fixtures/api-fixture.ts` is
otherwise closed to the UI stream, so a UI run that needs one reports it as a shared change rather than
writing it. Prefer extending an existing fixture over repeating its body in a spec.

## Reading the API surface

**`Read` `docs/automation/references/api-surface-reading.md`.** The `# API Surface` section of a requirements
document — what it answers, what it never answers, how `## Spec Gaps` and an inherited `Auth:` line are
read, what `Source:` means, and what to do when the section is missing — lives there, because both
streams read the same section and a second copy of those rules would drift from the first.

One line of it decides every question this stream asks of the surface: **a value you assert must appear
in the test design's `Expected:`.** The surface supplies the route, the verb, the parameter names and the
bearer requirement; the design supplies everything the test claims.

## Query parameters

`GET` collections take their filters and paging in the query string. The `// Act` rule does not change:
**one `with*()` per parameter the request sends**, so the whole request still reads at the point it is
made. A parameter set with a payload object, or spliced into the URL as a string, hides what was sent —
the same defect as `withBody` in an Act block.

The builder holds the query the way it already holds headers, and Playwright serialises it through
`params`:

```ts
export class GamesRequestBuilder {
  private query: Record<string, string | number | boolean> = {};
  private headers: Record<string, string> = {};

  constructor(private readonly request: APIRequestContext) {}

  // #region Query
  withQueryParam(name: string, value: string | number | boolean): this {
    this.query[name] = value;
    return this;
  }

  /** Named sugar for the parameters the API documents. */
  withLimit(limit: number): this {
    return this.withQueryParam("limit", limit);
  }

  withPage(page: number): this {
    return this.withQueryParam("page", page);
  }

  withSearch(search: string): this {
    return this.withQueryParam("search", search);
  }
  // #endregion

  async sendListGames(): Promise<ListGamesApiResult> {
    const response = await this.request.get(Endpoints.games.list, {
      params: this.query,
      headers: this.headers,
    });

    return toApiResult<ListGamesResponse | GamesErrorResponse>(response);
  }
}
```

and the Act reads as one line naming every parameter it sends:

```ts
// Act
const result = await api.games.builder().withLimit(10).withPage(2).sendListGames();
```

Rules for the sugar:

- Add a named `with*()` for a parameter the API surface documents, and use it. `withLimit(10)` says what the
  request means; `withQueryParam("limit", 10)` only says what it contains.
- Keep `withQueryParam` for a parameter no scenario names repeatedly, and for one the surface does not
  document — that case needs the escape hatch precisely because there is nothing to name it after.
- Never add a `with*()` for a parameter no scenario uses. A builder is grown by the tests that need it, not
  filled in from a route list.
- A parameter omitted from the chain is a parameter the request does not send. That is a meaningful test
  input — the default-paging case is `sendListGames()` with an empty chain, not `withPage(1)`.

## Filtering a shared collection

A filter parameter (`search`, and any `?field=` narrowing a collection) asks a question the rest of this
document does not: **the endpoint answers about records this test did not create.** The catalog is
shared, `fullyParallel` is on, and another spec is seeding and deleting rows in it while this one reads.
Four rules follow, all of them visible in `tests/api/games-search-api.spec.ts`.

**Search on a token the test seeded itself.** A term borrowed from the environment — the first row of
the collection, a shipped title — is data another spec may delete mid-test, and the failure reads as a
broken filter. Seed the matches, name them from a run-unique token, and the filtered set is closed:

```ts
// Arrange - two seeds under different tokens, so a term matching only one of
// them proves filtering rather than an empty catalog
const token = GameTestData.uniqueSearchToken();
const matchingGame = await seedGame(GameTestData.createSearchSeedPayload(token));
const otherGame = await seedGame(
  GameTestData.createSearchSeedPayload(GameTestData.uniqueSearchToken()),
);
```

The token belongs in `utils/test-data/`, like every other sent value, and it is **free of regex
metacharacters** — a term is a filter input, and a generator that emits `.` or `(` into one makes the
test's own data the variable under test.

**Read the count off the response, never off the environment.** A filtered page's `pagination` block
counts the whole match set, so it rules out a second match that landed off-page — which asserting on
`games.length` alone cannot:

```ts
expect(body.games.map((game) => game.name)).toEqual([matchingGame.name]);
expect(body.pagination.totalGames).toBe(1);
```

The same reasoning bars `expect(totalGames).toBe(21)`: a literal catalog size is a fact about one
machine at one moment. Where the scenario is paging, assert the metadata's internal consistency
(`totalPages`, `hasNextPage`, `currentPage`) and the union of the pages against the seeded ids.

**An empty result needs a positive control.** `games` coming back empty proves the filter excluded the
record *or* that the seed never landed, and those are opposite verdicts. Pair the empty assertion with a
second read that must return the same record — through the **controller**, since it is `// Assert`
plumbing and not the request under test:

```ts
// Act - the term is the description's token, which no name carries
const result = await api.games.gamesBuilder().withBearerToken(ownerToken)
  .withSearch(descriptionToken).withLimit(...).withPage(1).sendListGames();

// Assert
expect((result.body as ListGamesResponse).games).toEqual([]);

const byName = await api.games.listGames(ownerToken, { search: nameToken, ... });
expect((byName.body as ListGamesResponse).games.map((game) => game._id))
  .toEqual([seededGame.id]);
```

One `// Act` still means one request under test. A second *builder* chain in the same test is a second
Act and belongs in a second test — the genre and description cases are two tests for exactly that
reason.

**Choose absence-of-id over an empty page when a legitimate match could exist.** Searching for a genre
word must not reach the seed, but a shipped title carrying that word in its *name* is a correct match;
asserting an empty page would fail on somebody else's data. Assert what the scenario claims — that this
id is not in the result — and say in a comment why the stronger form would be wrong.

**A term that crashes the endpoint is asserted against the specification.** Where the filter is
interpolated into a pattern without escaping, a metacharacter term returns `500`. The test asserts the
outcomes the specification allows and lets the defect stand red, with a comment naming it:

```ts
// Assert - either outcome is defensible; a 500 is not one of them
expect([200, 400]).toContain(result.status);
```

Both defensible outcomes are named because the surface documents neither — inventing a single expected
status would be a guessed mechanic. Weakening this to `not.toBe(500)`, or to whatever the app currently
returns, deletes the report; the red test **is** the deliverable.

## A folded scenario — one test, two scenario ids

Most tests map one to one onto a scenario. The exception is a scenario whose block carries a third
classification line:

```
Assigned Level: E2E API
Level Rationale: … folded into SCN-012 by the minimum-set pass — same actor, same operation, a second value over the one request SCN-012 already makes.
Folds Into: SCN-012
```

That scenario gets no test of its own. It is asserted inside SCN-012's test, which is the only place it
is asserted at all — so an unimplemented fold is a scenario lost silently, with no missing test anywhere
to notice. Three things change in the covering test and nothing else does:

1. **The id comment names both** — `// SCN-012 (folds SCN-018)`.
2. **The arrange block seeds whatever satisfies both preconditions.** The folded scenario asks for more
   or different data than the covering one; you seed the union. The covering scenario's own assertions
   have to stay truthful against it — that is what made the fold legal in the first place.
3. **The folded scenario's `Expected:` becomes assertions in the same `// Assert` block**, carrying the
   folded scenario's own `FR-`/`AC-` ids, not the covering scenario's.

```ts
// SCN-012 (folds SCN-018)
test("List games - Should return the requested page with its pagination metadata", async ({
  api,
  ownerToken,
  cleanupTasks,
}) => {
  // Arrange - SCN-012 needs a populated catalogue; SCN-018 needs one large enough
  // that page 2 is non-empty. One seed satisfies both, which is why SCN-018 folds
  // here rather than repeating the same GET as a second test.
  const seeded = await seedGames(api, ownerToken, cleanupTasks, GameTestData.PAGED_BATCH_SIZE);

  // Act - one with*() per parameter the request sends
  const result = await api.games.builder().withLimit(10).withPage(2).sendListGames();

  // Assert - FR-10.2 (SCN-012): the page is returned with its metadata
  expect(result.status).toBe(200);
  const body = result.body as ListGamesResponse;
  expect(body.games).toHaveLength(10);
  expect(body.pagination.page).toBe(2);

  // Assert - FR-10.4 (SCN-018): totalGames counts the whole catalogue, not the page.
  // Folded scenario, so this carries its own requirement id.
  expect(body.pagination.totalGames).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(seeded.length);
  expect(body.pagination.totalPages).toBe(Math.ceil(body.pagination.totalGames / 10));
});
```

What a fold is **not**: a licence to merge two tests you find similar. Only a `Folds Into:` line
authorises one test to carry two ids, and it is written by the classification step, never here. Two
scenarios sharing a test without one is a Critical review finding. So is a covering test that grew a
**second `// Act`** to fit the fold — one test sends one request under test, and a folded scenario that
needs a request of its own was folded wrongly: implement the covering scenario, and record the folded
one under `Skipped Scenarios` with that reason rather than bending the phase structure around it.

## What the compliant example demonstrates, point by point

| # | The etalon shows |
|---|---|
| E1 | `test`/`expect` from `@fixtures/api-fixture`, never `@playwright/test` |
| E2 | fixtures destructured, not constructed: `api`, `ownerToken`, `createdAdminEmails` |
| E3 | builder for every `// Act`, one `with*` call per field sent, so the request reads in full at the point it is made — no `withMatchingPassword`, no payload object, no `withBody` |
| E4 | controller for every precondition and postcondition — the seed, the cross-check, the cleanup — where the short form keeps those steps out of the reader's way |
| E5 | cleanup registered **before** the call that creates the record; no `createdAdminEmails` at all when the call is expected to create nothing |
| E6 | every sent value from `AdminTestData` / `AuthTestData`, every contract regex from `ResponsePatterns` — no literal e-mail, password, ObjectId or regex in the spec |
| E7 | the one literal that does belong here: the expected response message, next to its assertion |
| E8 | `// Arrange` / `// Act` / `// Assert`, a `// SCN-` id per test, an `FR-`/`AC-` id on the assertion carrying it |
| E9 | assertions on `result.status` / `result.ok` / `result.body` (and `await expect(result.response).toBeOK()` on a happy path), plus absence assertions and a cross-check against `listAdmins` |
| E10 | a file-local helper only for **reading** a response — `errorMessages` above. A helper that *produces* test data belongs in `utils/test-data/` |
| E11 | a comment stating why a case is asserted loosely, when the design left the value open |
| E12 | title `"<Feature> - Should <behavior>"`, describe block named for the endpoint |
| E13 | no URL string, no credential literal, no `waitForTimeout` |
| E14 | a seeded precondition is a single `await seedGame(...)` line — no `if (id)` branch, no `as string` cast, no per-call-site `uncleanableResources` push, and no status assertion the fixture already makes by throwing |

## Non-compliant — the same intent, and the defects it carries

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";              // (1)

const OWNER_PASSWORD = "Owner12345@";                          // (2)

test("should create admin", async ({ request }) => {           // (3)
  const login = await request.post(
    "http://localhost:9000/api/auth/login",                     // (4)
    { data: { email: "owner@example.com", password: OWNER_PASSWORD } },
  );
  const token = (await login.json()).token;

| # | Defect | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | import from `@playwright/test`; the fixtures vanish and cleanup never runs | Major |
| 2 | credential literal in the spec instead of `Config` | Critical |
| 3 | title does not follow `"<Feature> - Should <behavior>"` | Minor |
| 4 | raw `request.post` and a URL literal, bypassing the controller, the builder and `Endpoints` | Major |
| 5 | a hard-coded e-mail containing a dot and a plus — `normalizeEmail()` rewrites it, and the record is never registered for cleanup, so the second run collides | Major |
| 6 | assertion on the raw `APIResponse` with no status and no body check; a 200 would pass as loudly as a 201 | Major |

The credential is the only Critical here. Everything else is Major or Minor — and none of the six is a
**coverage** finding, which is the separate and more valuable question: whether every scenario the test
design assigned to this stream actually got a test, and whether that test asserts what the scenario says.

### The hand-written seed block — a seventh defect, from a real spec

The example above does not carry this one, because it seeds an admin and `createdAdminEmails` already
covers that. It appeared the moment a spec needed a resource with no fixture of its own, and it appeared
**five times in two files** before anybody named it:

```ts
const seed = await api.games.createGameAndGetId(          // (7)
  ownerToken,
  GameTestData.createGamePayload(gameName),
);
if (seed.id) {                                            // (8)
  const id = seed.id;
  cleanupTasks.push({ label: `game ${id}`, run: async () => { await api.games.deleteGame(ownerToken, id); } });
} else {
  uncleanableResources.push(`game "${gameName}" - created but its id could not be read back`);
}
expect(seed.result.status).toBe(201);
const gameId = seed.id as string;                         // (9)
```

| # | Defect | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | twenty lines of arrange repeated per seeded record; the reader reaches the `// Act` four screens down | Major |
| 8 | branches on `id` rather than on whether the create succeeded, so a rejected request is reported as an unremovable leak — a false claim in the run output | Major |
| 9 | `as string` asserting away a case the line above proves is possible | Minor |

All three are one finding with one fix: **a seeding fixture**. A reviewer seeing this shape reports it
against E14 and points at `seedGame`; it is not a style preference, because (8) makes the cleanup report
untrue.
